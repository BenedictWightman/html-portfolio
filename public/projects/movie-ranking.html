    <h1>Ben's Ultimate Guide to Film Favourites</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Hot Rod</h3>
    <p>
      Possibly the most ridiculous movie I have ever watched and yet it remains
      my favourite.
    </p>
    <h3>Captain America: The first Avenger</h3>
    <p>
      RIP Cap. Probably the coolest avenger out of the lot and a great film
      combining the grit of the old wars with the might of modern superheros of
      the time.
    </p>
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>
      A thought provoking masterpiece. As a young scientist at university, this
      film expanded my mind further than I had ever thought before.
